    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working on getting a new site theme up and running for a while now. My hold up was that I could never commit to a platform. I knew that I wanted off Wordpress and onto something more developer friendly. Originally I was going to put this site on eZ Publish, but that just seemed like overkill. Next I thought about creating a Symfony2 blog, but I wanted to cheapen my hosting options so I opted against Symfony2. I finally decided upon Rails, hosted on the free tier of Heroku.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of development when I discovered Octopress. How I had never heard of this platform before, I don&rsquo;t know. In under 4 hours total I had my Wordpress site migrated off of Wordpress and onto a Github Pages site generated by Octopress; it was a very smooth transition. Because development was so fast, I opted to stick with Octopress and <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/" title="Deploying to GH-Pages">GH-Pages</a>.</p>

<p>My site is now running statically using Octopress as a site generator and Github as a free host. Octopress is built on Jekyll, so I can make plugins easily (in Ruby) as well as pull in any existing plugin with ease. Octopress seems like it is built to be <strong>the</strong> developer blogging platform. The code blocks, the post generation, and the fact that it is built on Ruby all helped me settle on Octopress as my new blogging platform. I hope you enjoy the new site!</p>
