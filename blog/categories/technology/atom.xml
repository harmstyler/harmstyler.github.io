<p>I recently updated to Skype 6 and found something interesting out. My style package that worked in Skype 5 would not work in Skype 6. With some digging, we found out that in order to make your Skype 5 style work in Skype 6 you need to update the <code>MessageViewVersion</code> to version 7 (I have no idea why). So, with that, have fun updating your Skype to the latest version while still getting use out of your favorite Skype theme.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="pull-right"><img title="Sublime Text icon" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hs_blog_content/images/sublime_text_icon_2181-150x150.png" alt="Sublime Text icon" width="150" height="150" /></div>


<p>A while back I fell in love with <a title="Sublime Text 2" href="http://bit.ly/MHuK34" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a> and its' many advantages over TextMate. What it lacked however was any real support for the eZ Publish templating language (no different than TextMate). What I wanted was a simple editor that offered variable and method highlighting equivalent to a nice IDE like PHPStorm. I was originally using the Smarty package for TextMate (you can use any TextMate package in Sublime), but that does not offer a lot of method highlighting support for eZ. So what I decided to do was use the Smarty package as a template for adding more language support for eZ Publish. What I have is far from complete; I usually only add to it when I use a method that is not already supported. You can find it out on <a title="ez sublime on GitHub" href="http://bit.ly/N4eTcp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It is my hope that there are some eZ Publish devs out there that really enjoy Sublime as I do and want to help me grow the package. Remember, it is far from complete, but nonetheless, I really hope that you enjoy the language highlighting, and if you doÂ feel free to contribute.</p>

<p>I am well overdue for a new HarmsSite post. So today I am going to talk about one of my favorite new tools. But first, an intro. Building out gradients is easy enough, get your start color and your end color and then plug them into all the various browser specific gradient css elements (webkit, moz, etc&hellip;) and you get a gradient. Like I said, simple enough but time consuming because each browser gets its own line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gradientapp.com/" title="Gradient App" target="_blank">Gradient App</a> makes life much simpler. As a Gradient App user all I have to do use the color picker, or manually enter my colors, then just choose my gradient direction and any other options I would be interested in! Gradient App then gives me the CSS code to use, again, making my life much easier.</p>

<p>Obviously, looking at the above code, simple gradients are fairly straight forward. Remember to cover all your browsers (the filter is for Internet Explorer versions older than IE10 as they do not recognize gradients). Also obvious, making your own gradients can be a bit tedious, which is why I used Gradient App to make the code you see above.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="pull-right"><a href="http://path.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56" title="path-logo" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hs_blog_content/images/path-logo-2x.png" alt="Path" width="146" height="65" /></a></div>


<p>Finally, Path has come to Android. Path is one of those little known apps that I think a person would love, if they knew about it. Path is made to be  built off of Facebook, but far more personal than that. Their slogan then makes sense, The Personal Network (vs the Social Network). At Path each person is only able to view a limited number of friends, making the social web experience more personal. They recognize the fact that each person in real life does not carry on relationships with 300 people, more likely 30 at the most. Because of this fact, they limit the web friends to the same number; this makes the social experience mean far more to the user. So, back to my original point, Path has been available for iPhone only since its inception. Path is not an internet app; unlike Facebook, I cannot upload photos online, I can only use my phone. Also, there are no status updates, Path is just you sharing photos with your closest friends. Path is a fantastic idea that I have been waiting to use for some time now, as I use Android. Path comes with it a simple and sleek UI, which I would expect being so limited on options and all. Just about the only bad part I can find is that not enough of my friends use it, yet. So myÂ recommendation? Go out and get the app, it should be fun.</p>
