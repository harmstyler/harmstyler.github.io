If you are like me, wanting to learn Symfony but lacking time and resources, you should really check this site out: <a href=http://tutorial.symblog.co.uk/ title="Symblog: Creating a Blog in Symfony2">Symblog: Creating a Blog in Symfony2</a></p><p>The blog starts with the basics and explores a good deal of Symfony components in detail. In the end you will be left with a barley usable blog, but that is alright, it leaves you with a project to fix. It is a tutorial for Symfony 2.0, and because Symfony is currently on 2.1.3 you will notice some part don&rsquo;t work the way you expect (but I think that forces you to learn more anyway). The tutorial also doesn&rsquo;t use Composer at all; so remember, when the blog tells you to install something, use Composer and skip over the way they tell you how to do it. I hope you enjoy the tutorial, I know I did.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/2012/skype-version-6/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
