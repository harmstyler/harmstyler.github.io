With these bundles, eZ reserves some routing paths for internal or admin use, paths that you might want for your own app. If you ever run across a path you want to use for your app, and not break an internal eZ feature, there is a simple solution: &lt;strong&gt;change the path config&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Media in eZ Publish 5</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2016/managing-media-in-ez-publish/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tyler.harms@gmail.com (Tyler Harms)</author><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2016/managing-media-in-ez-publish/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Managing media in an eZ Publish 4 install was always a pain point for me.

PHP is a very flexible language and Symfony2 is
a modern framework that forces many SOLID habits on developers. I also enjoy
working with AngularJS. AngularJS makes Javascript fun and much easier to work
with. Moreover, much like Symfony2, it forces good habits on developers. Getting
the two to work together, however, can be a little bit of a chore if not careful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Symfony2 Access Control</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2013/symfony2-access-conrol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tyler.harms@gmail.com (Tyler Harms)</author><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2013/symfony2-access-conrol/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am very new to Symfony development. While developing a side project app I found I needed to control access to a certain area to logged in users only. Based on my previous development history I was expecting to have to determine if a user was logged in via the controller. I figured I would need to find an &lt;code&gt;is_logged_in&lt;/code&gt; boolean and use it to determine user access control. What I found while doing my development is that Symfony2 takes care of access control in a much more eloquent way. Rather than having to determine if a user is logged in inside each controller, Symfony2 controls access using a system similar to its routing system. Inside a Symfony2 app there is, by default, a &lt;code&gt;security.yml&lt;/code&gt; file that is used to control access. Inside the &lt;code&gt;security.yml&lt;/code&gt; file locate the &lt;code&gt;access_control&lt;/code&gt; declaration. By simply declaring a route inside the &lt;code&gt;access_control&lt;/code&gt; yml array we can control which users have access to which routes, like so:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>eZ Publish 5 - First Thoughts</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2013/ez-publish-5-first-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tyler.harms@gmail.com (Tyler Harms)</author><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2013/ez-publish-5-first-thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://harmstyler.me/img/symfony-logo.png"

 &gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally decided on my first eZ Publish 5 project&amp;hellip; my site of course. I am currently in the middle of upgrading my wordpress install to eZ Publish. Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t really need anything more than a simple Wordpress install, but it will be nice to get an eZ5 site under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I am in the middle of development, there have been a few bumps in the development road that I have found and would like to share. Firstly, I can find no way to run eZ Publish 5 completely in legacy mode, no matter what I do my pagelayout template needs to be a twig template. I posed the question to the eZ Community and it sounds like this should be possible, but it just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work for me (see the discussion &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/WhVHwu" title="Overriding templates in eZ 5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I actually don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with this, it&amp;rsquo;s not like being forced to use Symfony is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learning Symfony</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/learning-symfony/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tyler.harms@gmail.com (Tyler Harms)</author><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/learning-symfony/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://harmstyler.me/img/symfony2.jpg"

 &gt;&lt;p&gt;I have spent a good deal of my freetime this past month or two learning as much about about the php framework Symfony as possible. The moment that eZ Systems announced that they were adopting the Symfony framework I knew that I would be be spending some time with it. I have found that Symfony doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the lowest barrier to entry so it has been a process, to say the least. I have a blog that has helped matters a great deal and so I wanted to give it some props here. If you are like me, wanting to learn Symfony but lacking time and resources, you should really check this site out: &lt;a href="http://tutorial.symblog.co.uk/" title="Symblog: Creating a Blog in Symfony2"&gt;Symblog: Creating a Blog in Symfony2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
