&lt;p&gt;I have been a devout git user for as long as I have been programming. I was lucky enough to bypass subversion entirely, at least that is what my friends who&amp;rsquo;ve used svn have told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about git is that it tracks changes, not files or directories. When I create a new empty directory that directory is not tracked by git because it has no file changes inside, hence, the directory will never make it into git until I add a file to that directory. For this example I am going to use the logs directory of a virtual site. In my logs directory I have two files, an &lt;code&gt;error_log&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;access_log&lt;/code&gt;. Apache error logs and access logs should never be tracked by version control because they are logs that are specific to the given system the site is installed on. However, we should try to track the logs directory in version control. As hinted at before, we can do this in one of two ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
