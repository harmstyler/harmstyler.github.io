As I said before, shards in eZ Find do not work out of the box. In the code the &lt;code>$shardQuery&lt;/code> is built properly but the variable is never actually used after it is created. What I did to make this work is a simple if/else block inside the &lt;code>$queryHandler&lt;/code> switch. I am not submitting this as a pull request to eZ Find at the moment just because I do not like the way I made this work, I feel like there is a better way to do it. Nevertheless here is my code to make Shards work, I hope you enjoy and moreover I hope you suggest a better way to make the code work ;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
