Internet Explorer 10 was supposed to be &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; premier IE web browser. Microsoft was so confident that they created a browser that could meet modern standards that they dropped conditional comments in IE10. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about developing for IE, just know that it sucks; it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, however, aleviated some by conditional comments that allowed for custom styles/js/whatever for IE versions. My first time working with IE10 I was made harshly aware that conditional comments no longer work. What&amp;rsquo;s worse, my site that functioned and looked great in IE9 no longer functioned in IE10. How does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
