I was faceting off of multiple &lt;code&gt;facet.fields&lt;/code&gt; and I found the need to sort them independently of each other. As far as I knew up to this point &lt;code&gt;facet.sort&lt;/code&gt; could only be set once. When I read the doc, however, it was claimed that the &lt;code&gt;facet.sort&lt;/code&gt; could be set on a per field basis; sadly no examples were provided nor was it explained any further. Luckily, after some digging, I found out that setting the sort (index or count) on a per field is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Solr to fit your needs Part 1</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/optimizing-solr-to-fit-your-needs-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tyler.harms@gmail.com (Tyler Harms)</author><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/optimizing-solr-to-fit-your-needs-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://harmstyler.me/img/Solr-logo.png"

 &gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that eZ Find is a fantastic implementation of &lt;a class="zem_slink" title="Apache Solr" href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="homepage" target="_blank"&gt;Solr&lt;/a&gt; functionality. With eZ Find you get a fantastic search, out of the box. eZ Find gathers all the content in your system and organizes it for you into strings, text, and keywords (there are more but those the types I use most often). It can look at an &lt;a class="zem_slink" title="EZ Publish" href="http://ez.no/" rel="homepage" target="_blank"&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt; keyword and know that it should thereby be a Solr keyword, again, all out of the box. There are however some serious limitations when it comes time to customize it to meet your system&amp;rsquo;s needs. Do not underestimate the power found in customizing Solr to meet your website&amp;rsquo;s needs. The default setup is great, it&amp;rsquo;s made to fit into any system with very little effort; but, just because it&amp;rsquo;s made to fit in any system does not mean that it should be used for every system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
