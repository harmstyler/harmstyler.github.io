In my last post I showed that eZ Find already ships with a default search field called &lt;code>ezf_df_text&lt;/code>. The downside of searching one field is that field needs to be controlled, and the only way it can be controlled is by manually editing the Solr schema file. As you might expect, eZ Find does not control this file very well out of the box.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solr Query for Mimicking SQL IN Operator Functionality</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/solr-query-for-mimicking-sql-in-operator-functionality/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/solr-query-for-mimicking-sql-in-operator-functionality/</guid><description>I did a lot of playing around with solr to get this right. Unfortunately there is not a lot of documentation on searching within a certain field. With the SQL language you can search for multiple terms in a given field using the IN operator. In Solr you have the option of specifying a field using the qf operator, but what if you have more search terms searching other fields? The problem becomes far more complex.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Solr to fit your needs Part 1</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/optimizing-solr-to-fit-your-needs-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/optimizing-solr-to-fit-your-needs-part-1/</guid><description>Let me start by saying that eZ Find is a fantastic implementation of Solrfunctionality. With eZ Find you get a fantastic search, out of the box. eZ Find gathers all the content in your system and organizes it for you into strings, text, and keywords (there are more but those the types I use most often). It can look at an eZ Publishkeyword and know that it should thereby be a Solr keyword, again, all out of the box.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Shards in eZ Find</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/fixing-shards-in-ez-find/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/fixing-shards-in-ez-find/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am way overdue on my promise to show you how to make shards work. As I said before, shards in eZ Find do not work out of the box. In the code the &lt;code>$shardQuery&lt;/code> is built properly but the variable is never actually used after it is created. What I did to make this work is a simple if/else block inside the &lt;code>$queryHandler&lt;/code> switch. I am not submitting this as a pull request to eZ Find at the moment just because I do not like the way I made this work, I feel like there is a better way to do it. Nevertheless here is my code to make Shards work, I hope you enjoy and moreover I hope you suggest a better way to make the code work ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solr 3.6 Update</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/solr-3-6-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/solr-3-6-update/</guid><description>Turns out that when using shards to search multiple cores (shards in general actually) binary is not returned properly. I found an update to the trunk (4.x) version of Solr and was successfully able to update my version of Solr 3.6. I am submitting a pull request of the code update to Solr as well a new war file to eZ Find, but in the meantime you can download the solr.</description></item><item><title>Searching Multiple Solr Cores using Shards and eZ Find</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ezfind-shards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ezfind-shards/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

What becomes a problem, however, is when a cross-site search is necessary. When the search fetch includes 'as_objects', true() eZ Find tries to build out an object by fetching from the database after the Solr search is completed and the necessary content is returned.</description></item><item><title>eZ Find Multi-Core</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ez-find-multi-core/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ez-find-multi-core/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the greatest things about eZ Publish as a CMS is its ability to host many websites (siteaccesses) in one eZ Publish install. Recently I had the privilege of working on an eZ install that hosted 4 websites, giving the illusion of a single site experience across multiple urls. We used eZ Find extensively, specifically its multi-core functionality, to get information across the sites with ease. That way, all the sites can keep and maintain their own databases, and what is shared is shared through Solr.&lt;/p>

eZ Find is an eZ Publish extension so: unzip the download, rename the fold &amp;ldquo;ezfind,&amp;rdquo; and then move the &lt;em>ezfind&lt;/em> folder to the &lt;em>extensions&lt;/em> directory of your eZ Publish install.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, as with any extension, we have to activate it. Go into your override &lt;code>site.ini.append.php&lt;/code> (settings/override/site.ini.append.php) and add ezfind to your active extension list (&lt;code>ActiveExtensions[]=ezfind&lt;/code>). I added mine just after my main site extension. Easy enough so far right?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>As you had probably already guessed, eZ Find will not without first setting up Solr. Luckily eZ Find comes with the recommended version of Solr for eZ Find. Within the eZ Find extension you should see a &lt;em>java&lt;/em> directory (remember Solr is written in Java?). So what we need to do is copy the java directory and move it to the htdocs level of your eZ Publish install and rename the folder &amp;ldquo;Solr&amp;rdquo; (see the image on the right). There is a lot in the solr directory that we will not need to mess with right now, specifically I will not cover the multicore options right now, just know that eZ Find can run multiple sites/cores on one Solr install. Also note that I just installed Solr locally, but it can also be installed on remote servers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>eZ Find Basics</title><link>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ez-find-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harmstyler.me/posts/2012/ez-find-basics/</guid><description>I have been thinking a long time about different topics I could use this blog for. I have settled for the moment on an eZ Publish extension that I have used extensively for a while, eZ Find. eZ Find is an ultra-powerful Solr powered search engine made for eZ Publish, authored by Paul Borgermans.
For starters, an introduction to eZ Find &amp;amp; Solr.

I came across this topic a while back when I was working on creating some custom facets for a website running eZ Find, powered by Solr. The Problem: I needed to bucket all the authors together by last name (eg. A-C, D-F and so on). I also wanted to do this all within Solr, since the book I was using for reference said it was possible and I did not want to use Javascript (I wanted to take advantage of Solr&amp;rsquo;s speed; let Solr do the work).</description></item></channel></rss>
